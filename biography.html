        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          In December 1891 Otto Dix was born into the Generation of 1914. He was
          one of millions of late 19th Century babies who ushered in the 20th on
          the battlefields of the First World War. Dix was the eldest son of Franz
          and Louise. His father toiled in a iron foundry and his mother was a
          seamstress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dix was exposed to art at an early age. He spent time in the studio of
          his older cousin, the landscape painter Fritz Amann. Children play – and
          Dix was no different – but gradually his art improved. Encouraged by
          elders, Dix took an apprenticeship with the landscape painter Carl
          Senff. In the early part of the 20th Century, he began to paint
          landscapes of his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1910 his apprenticeship was complete and Dix left home for Dresden.
          He had been accepted into the Saxon School of Arts and Crafts. Here he
          encountered influences that would greatly shape his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many Expressionists, Dix was moved by the Naturalist and Symbolist
          tendencies of the printmaker Max Klinger. He was first exposed the
          artist in Dresden. Nietzsche was popular then and Dix devoured his work.
          He would later claim his most important sources of inspiration were the
          Bible, Goethe, and Nietzsche.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Great War</h2>
        <p>
          Modern memory holds that the First World War was greeted with joy in the
          capitols of Europe. Perhaps, but a strange elation did drive many young
          men to the colors. Dix was twenty-two in the summer the arch duke died.
          When war was declared in August of 1914, he immediately volunteered.
          Most thought the war would be over by Christmas and worried they’d never
          get to the front. The stalemate lasted four long years.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Dix was originally assigned to an artillery unit in Dresden. In 1915, he
          was transferred as a NCO to a machine gun unit. Entrenched automatic
          rifles helped create the stalemate in Europe. Machine gunners sprayed
          bullets at advancing troops and they were very hard to take out. Dix
          helped defend the line against the great British advance on the Somme.
          Siegfried Sassoon, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkein were on the other side.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Dix was wounded several times along the Western Front. In August 1918,
          he served in Flanders where he took a nearly fatal wound to the neck. A
          medic was able to stop the bleeding and he was moved back to an aid
          station. The war ended with Dix in a hospital bed. He was discharged in
          September 1918.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          During the war, Dix kept a diary and a sketchbook with which he
          chronicled his experience. They would provide material for a major work
          of fifty prints called simply, The War. Dix was profoundly affected by
          the war. He described a recurring nightmare in which he crawled through
          bombed out houses. His experience with war and its aftermath became a
          dominant theme in the art he produced after 1914.
        </p>
  
        <br />
  
        <h2>Aftermath</h2>
        <p>
          Dix returned to Dresden after his military discharge. He resumed art
          studies as best he could but the war soon crept into his work. Dix was
          continually haunted by the brutality of war. His training in landscapes
          paid dividends as he tried to capture the desolate fields of Flanders,
          carved with military trenches and strewn with bodies. Dix emphasizes the
          disproportionate burden that was placed on soldiers. His infantry men
          are mutiliated, wounded, suffering or mad while his sailors are
          carousing with whores.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1921, Otto Dix traveled to Dusseldorf where he met Doctor and Frau
          Hans Koch. He was enthralled by both. The doctor, a urinology
          specialist, sat for a portraint in which Dix surrounded him with
          menacing medical equipment. He then took the doctor’s wife to his bed.
          When Dix returned to Dresden, Martha Koch followed him. She left her
          husband and two children behind. The Doctor was unperturbed because he
          had already begun an affair with Maria Lindner, his wife’s older sister.
          Dix and Koch became brothers-in-law and remained friends until the
          Doctor’s death in 1952.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dix met Karl Nierendorf the same year he met his wife. Nierendorf was an
          influential art dealer in Berlin. In 1924, he published Dix’s crowning
          achievement, a fifty piece portfolio of etchings entitled Der Krieg (The
          War). The series confronted mass inhibition on trauma that constrained
          memory of the Great War. It stood anathema to the myth of the war as a
          glorious cause. There was no “stab in the back.” There was mud,
          mutilation, death and futility.
        </p>
  
        <br />
  
        <h2>Degenerate</h2>
        <p>
          In 1926, Dix became a professor in the Kunstakademie in Dresden. He
          maintained that position until the Nazis rose to power in 1933. Modern
          art ran anathema to Adolf Hitler’s conservative sensibilities. Dix drew
          special ire as a prominent voice in the anti-war movement. He was
          stripped of his professorship and his paintings were displayed in the
          Degenerate Art Museum in Munich. They were later destroyed.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          In Nazi Germany, the countryside offered some respite from state
          oppression. After he was stripped of his professorship the Dix family
          moved to the shores of Lake Constance where he painted mostly
          inoffensive landscapes. He refused to emigrate since his paintings could
          not make the trip abroad. Surely, they would have been destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the latter stages of the Second World War Dix was conscripted into
          the Volkssturm. This was a national militia comprised of young boys and
          old men. He was captured by French troops as the Reich collapsed. He
          spent the duration in a French P.O.W. camp.
        </p>
        <p>Dix continued to work until his death in 1969.</p>
